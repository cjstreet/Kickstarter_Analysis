# Kickstarting Challenge 

### by CStreet

## Overview of Project
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
### Purpose

The overall purpose was to analyze and visualize the kickstarter data to look for patterns and/or trends to determine which variables or features impact the outcomes of raising money for kickstarter campaigns. There were two more specific goals. The first, was to analyze and visualize the outcome of Theater campaigns based on their launch date. The second, was to analyze and visualize the outcome of plays based on their monetary goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

To perform the analysis a pivot table and line chart have been created. These help to visualize the patterns in the data. The line chart is used to visualize outcomes based on month and outcomes based on monetary goals. Use built-in functions like SUM and COUNTIFS to calculate and implement conditions. Filtering allows you to see only specific data, while formatting allows your data to be readable and consistent. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

To perform the analysis you create a pivot table and chart. These help to visualize the patterns in the data.
Specifically, the line chart is used visualize outcomes based on monetary goals.  Filtering allows you to see only specific data, while formatting allows your data to be readable and consistent. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

A challenge with Excel is you have to be very careful when clicking in and out of cells. Another challenge was copying and editing the COUNTIFS function for the different outcomes was the most painful and tedious. There might be an easier way to do it but I am not aware of it. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Examining the Theater campaigns against the launch date, showed that theater campaigns increased over the spring and top out in May with 111 successful theater campaigns. This then begins to decrease over the summer and into winter. Failed theater campaigns were fairly consistent over the year ranging from 31 to 61. The highest number of failed theater campaigns occurred in July with 61. Canceled theater campaigns were overall much lower than failed and successful theater campaigns. October is missing data. The highest number of canceled theater campaigns was 7 in January to only 1 in July. 
It can be concluded that more play campaigns are being launched in May with 163 and the least in December with 71. Theater campaigns are more successful in May and June, 68% and 63% respectively of all theater launched. 


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

There were no cancellations for plays based on their goals. As the goal increased successful plays decreased and failed plays increased. Plays were the most successful when their goal was less than 1000 (76%). 88% of plays failed that had a goal of 50000 or more. Although there was an increase in successful plays (67%) and decrease in failed plays (33%) for goals between 35000 and 44999. We might want to examine other features/variables to determine what is causing this. 


- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Do we know how reliable this dataset is? This maybe a limitation. There is missing data for Theater Canceled Outcomes for October. Another limitation is we do not have a data dictionary. Is the launch date and deadline columns the date the kickstarter campaign begin and ended or was this the dates of the event itself. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We could have used pivot tables and bar charts to examine play outcomes based on countries or theater outcomes based on countries. Another good comparison would be the length of time a play was launched to its end date (how much time did they have to raise money). We could have calculated the central tendency and dispersion data to compare the mean, median, and check for outliers. We could have then created a box plot to visualize this information.
